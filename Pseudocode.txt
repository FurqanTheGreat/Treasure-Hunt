the click handler will do the following:

b. Calculate how far the click location is from the treasure
location.
c. Display a message on the web page to tell the player
whether theyâ€™re hot or cold.
d. Congratulate the player if they click on the treasure or
very close to it, and say how many clicks it took to find the
treasure.
